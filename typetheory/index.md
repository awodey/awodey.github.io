### Overview
This course focuses on type theory as a formal system, as well as its functorial semantics using category theory.  Emphasis will be on soundness, completeness, and representation theorems for various systems, with respect to topological, realizability, and (pre)sheaf models.  The lambda-calculus, for example, is modeled by cartesian closed categories, which can be represented both topologically and using presheaves (''Kripke models''). Locally cartesian closed categories model dependent type theories.  These can be strictified using hyperdoctrines, fibrations, and other tools.  We shall also consider Martin-L"of type theory, including universes, inductive types, intensional identity types, as well as Homotopy type theory.
