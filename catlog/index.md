### Overview
This course focuses on applications of category theory in logic. 
A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model
of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a structured category determined
by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a logical theory
and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, leading naturally to
the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from
classical semantics.  The lambda-calculus, for example, is treated via cartesian closed categories. Similarly higher-order logic is modelled by the categorical notion of a topos.  Using sheaves, topos theory subsumes Kripke semantics for modal and intuitionistic logics. And locally cartesian closed categories provide semantics for dependent type theories.  Time permitting, we may consider Martin-L"of type theory and its recent extension to Homotopy type theory.
