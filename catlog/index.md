### Overview
This course focuses on applications of category theory in logic. 
A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model
of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a structured category representing
by the theory. This gives rise to a syntax-invariant notion of a logical theory
and introduces many algebraic methods into logic, and leads naturally to
the universal and other general models that distinguish functorial from
classical semantics.  The lambda-calculus, for example, is treated via cartesian closed categories. Algebraic theories are represented by categories with finite products, following Lawvere.  And higher-order logic is modelled by the categorical notion of a topos.  Using sheaves, topos theory subsumes Kripke semantics for modal and intuitionistic logics. And locally cartesian closed categories provide semantics for dependent type theories.  Time permitting, we may consider Martin-L"of type theory and its recent extension to Homotopy type theory.

<!---
 - Jan 18: Class begins! Meet on zoom for a course overview and some planning.
- Jan 20: Meet on zoom for a review of category theory, as in the [lecture notes](/catlog/notes/catlog0.pdf).
- There is a [course zulip](https://baker.hott.dev/#narrow/stream/31-Categorical-Logic) for announcements and discussion.
- Posted the first half of the notes on [algebraic theories](/catlog/notes/catlog1A.pdf) for those who want to work ahead.
- Added a [course outline](./outline/).
